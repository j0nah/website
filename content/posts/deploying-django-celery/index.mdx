## Set Up
### What are we building?
We're going to build a very simple Django application that generates random numbers. The components are:
1. An API that can be used to submit a request for a random number. It will return an ID that can be used to look up the number when it's ready.
2. An API that can be used to look up a previously generated random number based on the ID from (1).
3. A background worker that executes and fulfills the requests to generate a random number.
4. A database to store the numbers and IDs in.

### What technologies will we use?
1. Python
2. Django
3. AWS
3. EC2 
4. RDS
5. Celery
6. Elasticache (as a backing datastore for Celery)

### Django Project
Let's create a Django project from scratch. You can also clone this repository [here](https://github.com/j0nah/randomnumbergen). 

```sh
django-admin startproject randomnumbergen
cd randomnumbergen/
```

Use whichever Python virtual environment tool you prefer. I like `Pipenv`.

```sh
pipenv shell
```

Run migrations
```sh 
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Make sure the local server is running

```sh
python managr.py runserver

August 13, 2023 - 20:31:06
Django version 4.2.4, using settings 'randomnumbergen.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

If you can reach your local server at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) then we're good to move on

### Random Number Application
We'll create a super simple application to house our model and views called `randomnumbers`

```sh
python3 manage.py startapp randomnumbers
```

Register the application in `settings.py`

```python
## randomnumbergen/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    ## custom applications
    "randomnumbers"
]
```

Let's add a model to store our data in

```python
# randomnumbergen/randomnumbers/models.py

from django.db import models

class RandomNumber(models.Model):
    # setting null to true because when we first create this record it will be null and later filled in
    # by the celery worker
    number = models.IntegerField(null=True)
```

Run migrations

```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
Now, let's set up a basic view to get some random numbers. We'll create two endpoints:

```
GET /randomnumbers/1/ # returns an ID and submits a request for a random number
GET /randomnumbers/<:id>/ # returns a status indicating whether or not the number is ready and a random number if it exists
```

Our view is super simple and looks like this
```python
# randomnumbers/views.py

from randomnumbers.models import RandomNumber
from django.http import JsonResponse

def random_number_request(request):
    rn = RandomNumber.objects.create()
    return JsonResponse({"id": rn.id})

def random_number_status(request, id):
    rn = RandomNumber.objects.get(id=id)
    response = {
        "id": rn.id,
        "status": "in_progress",
        "number" : None
    }

    if rn.number:
        response["status"] = "complete"
        response["number"] = rn.number

    return JsonResponse(response)
```

```python
# randomnumbers/urls.py
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # ex: /randomnumbers/
    path("", views.random_number_request),
    # ex: /randomnumbers/5/
    path("<int:id>/", views.random_number_status),
]
```

```python
# randomnumbergen/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('randomnumbers/',include('randomnumbers.urls')),
]
```

Restart your server, open a browser, and navigate [http://localhost:8000/randomnumbers](http://localhost:8000/randomnumbers). Your server should respond with:
```json
{
  "id": 1
}
```

Then head over to http://localhost:8000/randomnumbers/1](http://localhost:8000/randomnumbers/1). Your server should respond with:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "status": "in_progress",
  "number": null
}
```

If that all works then boom! We're done setting up our API and we're going to move on to our celery application.

## Set Up Celery Application
As a reminder, we want our Celery application to:
1. Generate a random number for each RandomNumber record with a null `number` filled
2. Update that record with the generated number

### Install Celery
```sh
pipenv install celery
```

### Install Redis
We'll use Redis locally for our message broker and task backend. Head over to the [Redis website](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/) for installation instructions.

Finally, install the Redis python package
```sh
pipenv install redis
```

### Make sure it's all working
We'll need a couple different terminals running for this one:

Start up your redis server
```sh
redis-server

57955:M 13 Aug 2023 15:58:35.888 # WARNING: The TCP backlog setting of 511 cannot be enforced because kern.ipc.somaxconn is set to the lower value of 128.
57955:M 13 Aug 2023 15:58:35.888 # Server initialized
57955:M 13 Aug 2023 15:58:35.888 * Ready to accept connections
```

Start up your Celery worker
```sh
python -m celery -A randomnumbergen worker
```

Uh oh! This fails with the error

```sh
TODO
```

That's because we need to define our celery config file. Inside the `randomnumbergen` directory, create a file called `celery.py`

```python
# randomnumbergen/celery.py

import os
from celery import Celery

os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "randomnumbergen.settings")
app = Celery("randomnumbergen")
app.config_from_object("django.conf:settings", namespace="CELERY")
app.autodiscover_tasks()
```

Darn! Stll more errors

```sh
[ERROR/MainProcess] consumer: Cannot connect to amqp://guest:**@127.0.0.1:5672//: [Errno 61] Connection refused.
Trying again in 4.00 seconds... (2/100)
```

We still need to define our broker and result URLs. We'll do this in the `randomnumbergen/settings.py` file

```python
# randomnumbergen/settings.py

# Celery settings
CELERY_BROKER_URL = "redis://localhost:6379"
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = "redis://localhost:6379"
```

Try one more time:

```sh
python -m celery -A randomnumbergen worker
```

and you should no longer receive any errors!

## Set Up Celery Task
Now that we've got out API and our Celery worker set up, let's define a very simple Celery task.
